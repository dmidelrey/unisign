Digital Signs Project
The website is an online service dedicated to creating electronic signatures for documents through the utilization of hash values. It employs cryptographic techniques to generate unique digital signatures for files, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the documents. Users can upload their documents to the platform, which then calculates a unique hash value for each document. Subsequently, this hash value is used to generate an electronic signature, providing a secure and tamper-evident way to verify the document's content and origin. This process helps users safeguard the integrity of their digital documents and verify their authenticity.
